# Java Repository Overview

This repository contains Java projects that demonstrate concepts such as abstract classes, interfaces, GUI development using Swing, inheritance, polymorphism, JavaDoc documentation, and JUnit testing.

## Contents

### 1. Abstract Class and Interface

#### Abstract Class Example

- **Animal abstract class:** Defines basic properties and methods common to all animals.
- **Derived classes:** Implement specific animals (e.g., Dog, Cat) extending `Animal`.

#### Interface Example

- **Flyable interface:** Defines a `fly()` method.
- **Bird class:** Implements `Flyable` interface, demonstrating how birds can fly.

### 2. GUI Using Swing

#### Swing GUI Example

- **Calculator GUI:** Implements a basic calculator using Swing components.
- **Event handling:** Shows how to handle events like button clicks.

### 3. Inheritance and Polymorphism

#### Inheritance and Polymorphism Example

- **Shape hierarchy:** Abstract `Shape` class with subclasses like `Circle`, `Rectangle`.
- **Polymorphic behavior:** Demonstrates overriding methods like `calculateArea()`.

### 4. JavaDoc Documentation

#### JavaDoc Example

- **JavaDoc comments:** Used extensively to document classes, methods, and fields.
- **Generated documentation:** Includes explanations, parameters, return values for methods.

### 5. JUnit Testing

#### JUnit Testing Example

- **Test classes:** Contains JUnit tests for critical methods.
- **Assertions:** Demonstrates assertions to verify expected outcomes.
